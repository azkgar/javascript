The foor loop simplifies the lines

let n = 0
while(n<100){
    console.log("Hello");
    n++;
}

can be simplified with a for loop like this:
for (let n=0; n< 100; n++) {
    console.log("Hello");
}

We can use simplified operators like these:

n++; n = n + 1;
n--; n = n - 1;
n*=3; n = n * 3;
n/=2; n = n / 2;

There is post increment and pre increment:

The pre-increment is: ++a The increment happens before the line ends.
The post-increment is: a++ The increment happens after the line ends.

while is better for task that need to be repeated for uknown number of times.
for is better for situations when we know the amout of repetitions.

Javascript has simplified the for loop to loop through items of an array, it's known as for of loop and it can be written like this:

for (const item of array) {
    console.log(item);
}
