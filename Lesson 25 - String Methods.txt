Similar to Arrays, Strings can also be slices using
string.slice(startPosition, endPosition);

There are other two methods:
substring(startPosition, endPosition);

substr(startPosition, length);

But it's recommended to use slice.

All string methods are non-mutating, meaning they won't change the original string

We can get a particular character in a String using:
string.chartAt(position) or string[position]

We can chanse the case of the string:
string.toUpperCase();
string.toLowerCase();

We can remove the extra blank spaces at the beginning and end of a string with the method trim:
string.trim();

To convert a string to an array we can use the method split.
let names = "Angela, Ben, Tom, Jenny, Helena";
let namesArray = names. split(", "); ["Angela", "Ben", "Tom", "Jenny", "Helena"]

We can also convert an array to a string using the method join.
let fruits = ["Apple", "BAnana", "Cherry"];
let fruitKebab = fruits.join("-"); // "Apple-Banana-Cherry";
