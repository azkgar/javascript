When we create a variable or a function they can be global or local
If the variable is created outside of a function it's global and it can be accesed everywhere.
If the variable is created inside of the function it's local and it can only be accessed in the function it was declared.

We can have a global and a local variable with the same name.

Local variables inside a block have a higher priority and will override any global variable with the same name.

In Javascript we have hoisting: using the function before it's declared.
