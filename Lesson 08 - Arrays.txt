Arrays hold multiple related pices of data in the same variable

const children = ["Jane", "Ben", "Tom"];

For an array to be valid the data type of the elements has to be the same

The position in the array starts from the first element in the left which would be index 0

const tom = children[2];

The items in the array can be modified even though when declared it's declared as a const
The constant part is the array but the items inside can be changed.

If you try to change the array to a string or a completely different array it will fail

const grades = ["A", "A", "B"];
grades = "A"; // error
grades = ["C", "C", "C"]; // error

grades[2] = "A" // It's ok

If you want to change the array then you need to declare it as let

let grades = ["A", "A", "B"];
grades = ["C", "C", "C"]; // it's ok
