We now know that we can group different elements using arrays, but what if the data is more complex?

We can create an Object like this:

let myCar = {
    color: "Red",
    mileage: 35000,
    seats: 5,
    owners: ["Tony", "Angela"]
}

console.log(myCar.color); //Red

in this example, color, mileage, seats and owners are Properties of the Object

The way we access any property value is using the dot notation

myCar.mileage; // Dot notation

or using the bracket notation

myCar["mileage"]; //Bracket notation

We can change the property values of an object:

myCar.mileage = 3500;

We can use the for in loop to get all the properties of an object:

for (propertyName in fruits) {
    console.log(propertyName);
}

To add more properties to the Object we can use the notation:
object.newProperty = value;
object["newProperty"] = value;

To delete a property we do the following:
delete object.property; -> This returns either true or false depending on the deletion (succcesful or failure)
delete object["property"];

We can have objects within other objects.

One of the most common formats to transfer information is the JSON (JS Object Notation)

let order1 = {
    number: 8463723,
    items: [
        {
            name: "Screws",
            quantity: 50,
        },
        {
            name: "Helmets",
            quantity: 2,
        }
    ],
}
