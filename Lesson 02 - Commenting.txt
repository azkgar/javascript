To write code in Javascript we use two forwards slashes at the beginning
    //This is a comment

The shortcut for commenting in windows is:
    Control + /
In Mac it's:
    Command + /

We can add a comment in-line such as:
    console.log("This is a text") //This is an in-line comment

For multi-line comment we use /* */ notation:
    /* This is a block of text
    that will be commented out */
