When we have multiple ifs checking related information we could end up with a massive code with if and else if.

To avoid this we can use the switch statement

switch (variable) {
    case value 1:
    // Do something;
    break;

    case value 2:
    // Do something
    break;

    default:
}

if we don't add the break statement it will create a fall through where all the actions below our case will be executed.

we can't use logical operators in the switch cases

So to avoid duplicating the same output for multiple cases we can stack them:

switch(variable) {
    case value 1:
    case value 2:
    case value 3:
        // Do something;
        break;
    default:
}

In cases not only does it has to match in value, it also has to match in data type.
