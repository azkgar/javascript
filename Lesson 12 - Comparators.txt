In Javascript we can use the comparator operator symbols such as:
    Greater than >
    Lesser than <
    Greater or equal >= // if there's a space between the > and the = the computer will get confused
    Lesser or equal <=

Javascript has lexicographical comparison to do string comparation against other strings:
    "Ben" < "Jane" // true
    "a" < "b" // true

Javascript uses the unicode to compare characters

We can also compare to see if two things are equal:
    Equality ==
    Not Equal !=

Same vs. Identical
Javascript handles different data types comparation such as:
    800 == "800" // Javascript automatically converts data types so this is True

    800 === "800" // We force Javascript to keep the data types using === so this is false
