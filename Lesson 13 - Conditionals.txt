if (this is true) {then do that}
else {do this}

The correct syntax of an if else statement is as follows:

if (age >= 16) {
    console.log("You can drive.");
} else {
    console.log("You're not old enough to drive.");
}

You can have multiple if statements one after the other.
You need to be careful on the order of the if statements, if the conditions are met all if statements could be triggered.

The alternative to multiple related conditions would be the else if:

if {}
else if {}
else if {}

the else if will go in order from top to bottom and it will stop checking once once of the previous is triggered.
