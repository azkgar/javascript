We have a function to symulate random numbers

Math.random(); -> Generates a random number between 0 and 1, it can be 0 but doesn't go up to 1

We can use Math.floor(n); to remove the decimals and get the integers.

We can pick random items from an array creating an index with Math.random()

Math.random() * fruitsArray.length
