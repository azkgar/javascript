String data type:
    "Everything between quotes is text or string"
    "Even numbers"
    In Javascript "3" + "4" equals "34"

Number data type:
    Numbers without quotes are numbers:
    3 + 2 = 5
    There are different types of numbers.
    We have integers when there's no decimal point:
        3
    We have floats when there's a decimal point:
        3.14159
    In most coding languages Floats and Integers are different data types
    In Javascript they are the same, just numbers.

Boolean Data Type:
    It can only be either true or false


To check the data type of any piece of data we can use:
    typeof("3" + "3");
    // string + string = string

When we have a plus sign in a String and a Number ("3" + 1) we get a string "31"
When we have a minus sign in a String and a Number ("3" - 1) we get a number 2

To manually convert a data type we can:
    Convert to Number:
    Number("42") // 42

    Convert to String:
    String(123) // "123"
    
    Convert to Boolean:
    Boolean(0) //false
