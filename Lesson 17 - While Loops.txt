A while loop is a way for the computer to repeat a chunk of code multiple times until something changes.

while(/* this condition is true */){
    // Execute this
}

If you don't set a way to stop the loop you will fall in something called as Infinite Loop.
Meaning it will never end.

A variation of the while loop is the Do-While Loop
The difference is that the code is run first so it will run once alway.

do {
    // Run this code block at least once
} while (/* Some condition is true */)

We can use a break inside a while loop to exit the loop early.
